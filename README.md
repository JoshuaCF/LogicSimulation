# TLDR
If you're some wanderer that has found their way here, quick TLDR: this is intended to become a logic simulation program much like many you might find freely online, though this will be tailored to my tastes. If you're reading this, it is NOT complete, and not usable.

# Description
This is a project I've started that is almost certainly too ambitious for what I can do. 

I am learning OpenGL through this project, as well as learning how to do unsafe Rust (mere days after learning regular Rust), and I'm furthering my knowledge of how to work with the Win32 API (something I've only worked with on extremely small scales before -- just a few function calls).

This is almost certainly going to have a plethora of issues by the time I am done with it, but hopefully it'll at least be a functioning mess and not a non-functioning unfinished mess.

I want this to be a logic simulation program, quite like many you might find freely online. This is the first program I'm making that has practical use. I've decided to make this because I was unhappy with every logical simulation program I found online for one reason or another, so I've taken it upon myself to write a program that can perform logic gate simulation with (hopefully!) well-optimized performance and including all the features I would like to see in a logic simulator.

**This is going to be tailored to my specific tastes. IF I even finish this (and frankly, it's unlikely when you consider how many projects I've abandoned in the past), perhaps others might find it useful.**
